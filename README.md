This Project is about building a Loan Prediction system using Machine Learning with Python.
Machine Learning algorithm : Support Vector Machine Model
SVM is preferred over other algorithms when :

1)The data is not regularly distributed.

2)SVM is generally known to not suffer the condition of overfitting.

3)Performance of SVM, and its generalization is better on the dataset.

4)And, lastly, SVM is known to have the best results for classification types of problems.
